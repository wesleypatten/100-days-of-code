# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 4th 2025

**Today's Progress**: Worked replacing the odin-recipes folder in my Git Hub account with the one from my Local Machine and Git. I also worked on building a simple 4 page website about Stoic Philsophers.

**Thoughts:** It was really hard to remeber how to start with git and git hub. I used Chatgpt to help me with the git commands I needed to accomplish the task. I was successful but it took
me an hour to figure it out. However I learned a lot about the difference between my local machine, git and git hub in the process.

### Day 1: March 5th 2025

**Today's Progress**: WOrked on Stoic Phiosophers website adding css and html to the pages and learning about the webpage layouts using container and div codes. I also learned a little about flexbox and block.

**Thoughts:** I need to work more on how to layout webpages using a combination of flexbox and css grid. I don't know anything about grid and very little about flexbox. I think soe work on the recipes odin recipes page tomorrow will help.

### Day 3: March 11th 2025

**Today's Progress**: Wrote, with the help of Chatgpt the html and css of a landing page for a walking tour website on the west coast of Ireland. It took an hour to get the code through prompting and it was a good first attempt at this type of page.

**Thoughts:** I learned the difference between a section tag and a div tag, I also began the implementation of flex with regards to laying out the different sections and divs. It is just the beginning, I know there is much more to learn. One thing I have to be wary of is when using Chatgpt to generate css, it can be prone to use duplicate classes and ids. I had to get Copilot to rewrite that code when I noticed the header and footer had duplicate nav classes with different styles.
