# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 4th 2025
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Worked replacing the odin-recipes folder in my Git Hub account with the one from my Local Machine and Git.

**Thoughts:** It was really hard to remeber how to start with git and git hub. I used Chatgpt to help me with the git commands I needed to accomplish the task. I was successful but it took
me an hour to figure it out. However I learned a lot about the difference between my local machine, git and git hub in the process.
